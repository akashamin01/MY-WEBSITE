  Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>
As a final-year student in the Bachelor of Computer Engineering I am keen to apply for the position of Web Developer at
your company. I am ready to apply what I learnt from my academics and eager to expand my knowledge from tenured
professionals and seniors. My potential to work in this field is evident from my projects. I am confident that my skills are
sharpened enough to be a perfect fit for your company.<br><br>
My technical qualifications include many programming languages like C, C++, Java, PHP, Html, CSS, XML. I have made 7
personal projects as well as 4 team projects using these languages where I was a leader and I had a team of 4 members. I
was able to manage a group of 4 people, assign tasks according to their capacities and help resolve their issues. Through
this, my team was successfully able to complete the development of application in time limit. This role added to my
experience of leading groups and getting work done. Apart from the projects, I also proved myself in academics by
achieving 85+ in all the semesters. Furthermore, I have also attended many trainings and competitions which took place
in different parts of the country.<br><br>
In addition to the above mentioned education and experience, I possess a number of strengths. I am a very strong
problem solver which I apply daily by debugging and solving coding problems. Also I am a very positive, hardworking and
motivated person which I believe is the biggest reason for my achievements that I received from my academics and
extracurricular activities. I was also a leader in multiple events of my college. These along with strong knowledge of Web
Development programming languages make me a suitable candidate for the Web Developer position.<br>
I welcome the opportunity to meet with you in an interview. Please contact me at my LinkedIn profile. I am available
flexible hours and believe that you will find me a perfect match for your position. Thank you for reviewing my
application.<br><br>
<p> Respectfully,<br>
Akash Amin
