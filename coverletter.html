  Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>
As a final-year student in the Bachelor of Computer Engineering I am keen to apply for the position of Web Developer at your company.
 I am ready to apply what I learnt from my academics and eager to expand my knowledge from tenured professionals and seniors.
 I have shown my capacity to work in this field through my academics and projects, so I am excited to be a part of your group.
<br><br>
My technical qualifications include so many programming languages like C, C++, Java, PHP, Html 5, CSS 3, XML and MySQL.
 I have made 7 personal projects as well as 4 team projects using these languages where I was a leader.
 I was able to led a team of 4 members, assign tasks according to their capacities and help resolve their issues.
  Through this, my team was successfully able to complete the development of application in time limit.
   This role added to my experience of leading groups and getting work done. Apart from the projects,
